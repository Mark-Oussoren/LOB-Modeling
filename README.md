This semester, the repo will serve to compile a collection of fundamental market making models, as well as explorations of my own.

Notes: 
- more data to test can be found here - http://sebastian.statistics.utoronto.ca/books/algo-and-hf-trading/data/
  or here - https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php
- Correlation returns a 2x2 - the stat you're after is the 12 or 21 entry
- Likewise, for the p-value from cointegration - the second value in the tuple
- I eyeball means and variances for the individual processes and split into three parts, but that can easily be modified to your liking
